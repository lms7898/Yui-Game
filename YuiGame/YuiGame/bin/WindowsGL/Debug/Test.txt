Opening
You awake in a daze, your head pounding.
You remember finding the fallen human, as well as the mystical
blue flame that emerged from him. You remember absorbing it.
A samurai witnessed this. He raised his sword against you.
You don't know why. You don't know what you did wrong. 
All you know is that you must survive. 
This morning you were just a normal fox.
But now, you're something more.
